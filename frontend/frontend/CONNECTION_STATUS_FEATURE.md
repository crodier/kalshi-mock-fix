# WebSocket Connection Status Feature

## Overview
Added a connection status banner that displays at the top of the page when the WebSocket connection is lost or unavailable.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Connection Status Banner
- **Location**: Fixed position at the top of the page
- **Behavior**: Only shows when disconnected or connecting
- **States**:
  - Connecting: "Connecting to server..." (orange)
  - Disconnected: "Not connected to server" with ⚠️ icon (orange)
  - Error: Shows error message in red

### 2. WebSocket Service Updates
- Added connection state tracking with three properties:
  - `isConnected`: Whether WebSocket is connected
  - `isConnecting`: Whether currently attempting to connect
  - `error`: Error message if connection failed
- Added observer pattern for connection status changes
- Updates state on all connection events (open, close, error)

### 3. Visual Feedback
- Smooth slide-down animation when banner appears
- Pulsing warning icon for better visibility
- Responsive design that works on mobile
- Page header adjusts position when banner is shown

### 4. Automatic Reconnection
- Attempts to reconnect up to 5 times
- Progressive backoff delay between attempts
- Shows "Max reconnection attempts reached" after exhausting retries

## Testing

1. **Normal Operation**:
   - When backend is running on port 9090, no banner shows
   - WebSocket connects automatically on app load

2. **Disconnection Test**:
   - Stop the backend server
   - Banner appears with "Not connected to server" ⚠️
   - Console shows reconnection attempts

3. **Reconnection Test**:
   - Start backend while app is showing disconnected banner
   - Banner disappears when connection is restored
   - All subscriptions are automatically restored

## Files Modified

1. **New Files**:
   - `src/components/ConnectionStatus.jsx` - Banner component
   - `src/components/ConnectionStatus.css` - Banner styles

2. **Updated Files**:
   - `src/services/websocket.js` - Added connection state management
   - `src/App.jsx` - Integrated ConnectionStatus component
   - `src/services/api.js` - Updated to use port 9090

## Usage

The connection status is automatically managed. No manual intervention required. The banner will:
- Show when WebSocket cannot connect
- Hide when connection is established
- Display appropriate messages for different states
